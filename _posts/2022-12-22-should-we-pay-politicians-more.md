title: Should We Pay Politicians More?

It's kind of a weird idea, but I think paying politicians and people in positions of government would actually help our current situation. Let me explain why.

# Politicians suck

Currently, the state of our government seems to be chaos. (Maybe it's always been, I don't really know) It seems to me that people in government positions disagree about things that everybody wants, just because of a party rivalry or complicated politics. I don't know about you, but I think that politicians should do what the people want!

# How much politicians get paid

According to [PayScale](https://www.payscale.com/politician-salaries) and my limited knowledge of how these salaries work, the average politician in a 2010 federal government position got paid about $110,000. This is a lot of money for the average person, but keep in mind that these are the people that are running our nation.
