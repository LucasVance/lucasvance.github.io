# On ChatGPT

## Background

For those of you who do not know, [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is "a computer program designed to assist with answering questions and providing information on a wide variety of topics," as described by itself. In other words, it is an AI program that can intelligently, and for the most part, accurately answer questions. It works by using the GPT-3 (Generative Pretrained Transformer v3) AI model by OpenAI finetuned for language. If you haven't tried it yet, you definitely should, although you do have to verify your humanity by using a phone number.

## What ChatGPT can do

ChatGPT is advanced, but it's hard to understand really how powerful it is unless you try it yourself. Here are some screenshots of it in use:
